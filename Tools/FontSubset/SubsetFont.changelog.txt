1.1.1 
	Bug fix: Now font checksum is corrected after name randomization
1.1.0
	New feature: Randomize font name
				If the embedded font is not unloadded correctly(program crashed, killed in task manager, etc.), it will stay in memory. Windows will not load font with that name anymore, instead it will just use the one in the memory. You can fix this problem only by re-log. 
				This new feature can be used to solve this problem. Name of the new font is randomized, so different subset of a same font will not confuse system.
				Usage: Add -randomize or -r to command line. The original and new name will be written into standard output.
	New feature: Preview characters
				Shows a window displaying all characters in the character list, using the generated font.
				Usage: Add -preview or -p to command line.
	Bug fix: When reading file with BOM, the BOM is read as a character.
